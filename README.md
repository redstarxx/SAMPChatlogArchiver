# SAMP Chatlog Archiver
A program coded to archive and name each archived chatlogs based on date/time of archiving. It works in a simple way. Low resource usage (minimum CPU, 10 MB of RAM at max). 

Archived chatlogs are stored inside a new folder in SAMP documents directory with a folder named "archived chatlogs". This program gives the user an option to start on startup by clicking Settings and requires administrator privileges to do so.

## Requirements
â€¢ [.NET 4 Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net40)
## Notes
You may notice that the archiving process is not instant. It may take up to 2-3 seconds to archive the produced chatlog.txt. The reason for that is in the light of lowering system resource consumption.
